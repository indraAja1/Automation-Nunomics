- **NPM** - A tool to install the Appium Server in Node.js.

### Hereâ€™s how to install Appium using Node.js

1. **Instal Node.js**

Appium requires Node.js to run. If Node.js is not installed on your system, you can download and install it from the official **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** website. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for better stability.

2. **Install Appium Server via npm**

Once Node.js is installed, you can install the Appium server using npm (Node Package Manager), which is part of the Node.js installation.

Open a terminal or command prompt, and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g appium
```

The above command will install Appium globally on your system, so you can run it from anywhere.

3. **Start the appium server**

After installation is complete, you can start the Appium server with the following command:

```bash
appium
```

This will start the Appium server on the default port (`4723`). If you want to run it on a different port or customize other configurations, you can use additional flags like this:

```bash
appium server -p 4723 -a 127.0.0.1 -pa /wd/hub --allow-cors
```

- **`p 4723`**: Sets the Appium server port to `4723`.
- **`a 127.0.0.1`**: Sets the server IP address to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).
- **`pa /wd/hub`**: Sets the base path to `/wd/hub`.
- **`-allow-cors`**: Enables CORS to allow requests from different domains.

4. **Verify Installation**

To ensure that Appium has been installed correctly, you can run:

```bash
appium -v
```

This will display the installed version of Appium.
